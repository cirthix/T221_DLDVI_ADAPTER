This is the T221 DLDVI Adapter.  It allows DLDVI video signals to drive the DG5/DGM/DGP variants of the IBM T221 and is functionally similar to the IBM 'converter box'.
	
The 'Outputs' directory contains all information needed to create or debug one.

There have been minimal (mostly cosmetic) changes from the actual production run due some file conversion and cleanup.
